CGI-Perl application for monitoring Proxmox resources

Generated by Bolt.new AI (not tested)

I've created a modular CGI-Perl application for monitoring Proxmox resources. Here's what each file does:

    config.pl: Configuration file for Proxmox API credentials
    ProxmoxAPI.pm: Handles API communication with Proxmox
    ResourceProcessor.pm: Processes and organizes the API response data
    HTMLRenderer.pm: Generates HTML output
    index.cgi: Main entry point that ties everything together

To deploy this on your server:

    Install required Perl modules:

cpan install LWP::UserAgent JSON

    Copy all files to your CGI-enabled directory (usually /usr/lib/cgi-bin/)

    Set proper permissions:

chmod 755 index.cgi
chmod 644 *.pm config.pl

    Edit config.pl with your Proxmox credentials

    Access the application through your web server's CGI URL (typically http://your-server/cgi-bin/index.cgi)

Important security notes:

    Store config.pl outside the web root if possible
    Consider using API tokens instead of password authentication
    Implement proper authentication for the web interface
    Consider using HTTPS for secure communication

The application will display a clean, organized table of your VMs and containers, showing their IDs, names, status, memory usage, and CPU allocation.
